        <h2>The Possibilities of a Future High Speed Rail Network</h2>
        <p>Although the United States may be far behind other developed countries in the Developed World, there is still a lot we can do to make rail transportation a viable, climate friendly transportation option for many regions across the United States.</p>
        <h3>Factors for Developing Successful High Speed Rail Networks</h3>
        <p>Housing density and population are two very important factors for the success of regional rail networks and High Speed Rail Lines. If residents cannot easily get to the train station without a vehicle, they will be less likely to use the trains at all, so it is vital that development of a rail network coincides with changing zoning laws and housing policies.</p>
        <h3>How we can make High Speed Rail work for the United States</h3>
        <p>As we begin developing a High Speed Rail Network, there are a few important things to consider in order for the project to be successful. Firstly, High Speed Rail should connect cities where there is sufficient demand, it makes no sense to spend the money connecting cities that people are not traveling between. Secondly, these cities that are on a High Speed Rail Line must allow for the proper density of housing and retail to be built around the train station, ensuring that as many people as possible have easy access to the new system.</p>
